# Vimium Configuration

This repository contains personal configuration files for the [Vimium Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb) and [Vimium for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/).

## Configuration Files

Vimium offers powerful customization options primarily through two dedicated files:

### `custom.css`

This CSS file empowers you to visually tailor Vimium's interface elements. Key areas you can customize include:

*   **Hint Markers**: Adjust colors, font sizes, backgrounds, and more for the clickable hints.
*   **Heads-Up Display (HUD)**: Style the command line, status messages, and other overlays.
*   **Find Mode**: Modify the appearance of the search bar and highlighted text.

### `config.json`

This JSON file provides advanced control over Vimium's behavior and functionality. It allows you to configure:

*   **Key Mappings**: Remap default commands or define entirely new keyboard shortcuts.
*   **Search Engines**: Set up custom search providers for quick access via the omnibar.
*   **Blacklist/Whitelist**: Control Vimium's activation on specific URLs or domains.
*   **General Settings**: Fine-tune various other preferences and operational aspects.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to apply your custom Vimium configuration:

1.  **Install Vimium**: First, ensure you have the Vimium extension installed from your browser's respective store (Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons).

3.  **Import Configuration**:
